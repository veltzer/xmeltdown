installation instructions for xmeltdown et al:

Prerequisites:
0. X11 libraries and headers files to link against.
	If they are not in the usual place then edit Makefile
	to reflect so.
1. GNU make. I don't know if other make systems will eat my
	Makfile. Oh yes - I don't even care... GNU rulez!!!
2. gcc. Only tested this with GCC. See (1).
3. XFree. Only tested it with XFree. You may get it to run with
	other X implementations. But you may even make it to
	Mars if you join NASA today...

Here come the real instructions:
0. Look at Makefile and make sure that the parameters
	are ok for your system. Especially look at the
	DEST parameter which is where the binaries will
	reside.
1. compile using "make". If there are problems then go
	fix them. Problems could include:
	a. compiler include paths.
	b. gcc to be replaced with some other compiler.
	c. flags to the compiler to be changed.
	d. prototype problems.
	And much much more!!!
2. run "make install". This stage has to be done as root
	if you're installing in a root owned directory. No
	need to be root if you'll just keep the binaries in
	your home directory or in a directory that you have
	write permission to.

Have fun!
